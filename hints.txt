# Completion Selections Keys
autocomplete uses control-n to go down and control-p to go up
but I have changed it to use cntrl-j and cntrl-k for selecting completion options
and using TAB to select completion, which should also auto include import statements

# Commenting
Assuming <leader> is \
Use <leader>ci to comment/uncomment
Use the above with visual mode to comment blocks
